## Run the app:

Clone repository and use node and npm versions in package.json file, install them if not already installed.


1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`


Emulator must be running in the separate terminal.
Download, build and run Bot-framework emulator. The easiest way is to simply load Source code (tar.gz)
and build it with the following steps:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run start`

The next thing that should be done is putting app ID and password into emulator window
  appId: "607b6eb5-3eb4-4f2d-a0e9-38b471a4979a"
  appPassword: "9Yhoxk9oJyqo18Xog1hT4sH"
